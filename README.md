# Ragent

**Ragent** is a research-focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to ingest, index, and query large document collections of documents in english and other indic languages using semantic chunking, semantic search and generative AI.

## ✅ Prerequisites
Make sure [ollama](https://ollama.com/) is installed on your system. Then,
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```
Create a `.env` file in your root folder, containing:
```
API_KEY="SECRET"
INGEST_DIR = "./your/path"
```
`API_KEY` is the API KEY of the RAG.
`INGEST_DIR` is where the files you want to ingest are stored. Currently only PDFs and .txts are supported.

## 📥 Ingestion Workflow

1. Place PDF files inside the `data/` directory
2. Run the ingestion script:

```bash
python -m ingestion.ingest
```

3. The pipeline will:

   * Load PDFs
   * Semantically chunk text
   * Generate embeddings based on the language of the text
   * Store chunks + metadata in ChromaDB

Embeddings are persisted to disk using `PersistentClient`.
